        <h1>Koshary Recipe</h1>
        <p class="para">Koshary is pretty much Egypt's staple street food. You can find \n anything from a 2-story
            koshary restaurant to a man with a cart on the side of the street. It has no meat, but even the biggest of
            carnivores don't miss it.</p>
